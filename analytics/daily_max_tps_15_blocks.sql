-- might be slight differences due to how timestamp is truncated (ms vs us)
-- our target block is b
-- look 15 blocks in the future (a)
-- look 1 block in the past (c)
-- take the difference in version and subtract out 2 non-user txn per block
-- non user txn: block metadata (every block) and state checkpoint (most blocks)
