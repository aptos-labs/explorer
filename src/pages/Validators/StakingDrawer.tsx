            What is delegated staking?
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
            As an APT holder, you can ‘delegate’ your APT to a delegation pool.
            The total delegation pool is an aggregation of staked APT from
            various token owners, and collectively staked. Aptos is a
            proof-of-stake network, which means that tokens are staked to
            validators in order to keep the network healthy.

            When you delegate stake, you own the tokens and earn{" "}

            }{" "}
            on top of the staked amount. At no point does the validator have any
            access to your tokens as they remain securely in your control. The
            delegation smart contract has undergone security audit and thorough
            testing before launch.

            How can I stake APT?
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
            You can stake APT directly by going to the Explorer page and
            connecting your wallet. If you are using the Petra wallet, you
            should see the following flow:
          </Typography>
        </ListItem>
        <Divider flexItem sx={{marginY: 1}} />
        <Button
          variant="outlined"
          sx={{margin: 1, marginTop: 2}}
          href={REWARDS_LEARN_MORE_LINK}
          target="_blank"
