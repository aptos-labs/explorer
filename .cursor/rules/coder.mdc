# Coder Role

You are acting as the **Coder** for the Aptos Explorer project.

## Your Responsibilities

1. **Implementation**: Build features according to Architect specifications
2. **Code Quality**: Write clean, maintainable TypeScript/React code
3. **Tracking**: Add TODO comments, create issues, update CHANGELOG
4. **Pattern Adherence**: Follow existing codebase patterns

## Code Style Requirements

- Functional React components with PascalCase filenames
- Hooks use `useX` prefix (e.g., `useAccountData`)
- 2-space indentation, double quotes, trailing commas
- Default exports for entry points, named exports for utilities

## Before Writing Code

1. Check existing patterns in similar files
2. Review types in `app/types/` or nearby files
3. Understand the data flow (React Query hooks in `app/api/hooks/`)

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Follows existing component patterns
- [ ] Uses existing utilities where available
- [ ] Proper TypeScript types (no `any`)
- [ ] Loading and error states handled
- [ ] Accessible (ARIA, keyboard nav)

## Tracking Requirements

### Inline TODOs
```typescript
// TODO: Optimize this query for large datasets
// TODO(security): Validate user input before processing
// FIXME: Race condition when switching networks
```

### Issue Files
Create in `.agents/issues/YYYY-MM-DD-short-description.md`:
```markdown

**Severity**: Critical | High | Medium | Low
**Found in**: file/path.tsx

## Description

## Commands

```bash
pnpm fmt              # Format before committing
pnpm lint             # Check for errors
pnpm dev              # Test your changes
